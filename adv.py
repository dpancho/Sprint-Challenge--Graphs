# These are the things that i pulled out of the problem to focus on

# First pass solution: 
# Record the room in visited
# Get all the exits with the room.
# Move in one direction, add this to the traversal path and pop it off the directions associated with the room
# Work out the opposite direction and add this to a reverse path so that backtracking is possible and remove the opposite direction from the unexplored paths
# Get exits for the new room and keep note of this (in visited)
# Move in a random direction again and add to the traversal path and pop it off the possible directions
# Keep moving until you reach a dead end
# When there are no more unexplored exits - backtrack along the last direction on the backtracked path and remove it from the backtracked path and add it to the traversal path
# Check that room for unexplored directions and repeat the process again
# This keeps going until the number of rooms visited reaches the length of the rooms graph
